# rnxtract

# this repository contains python scripts, documentation for the script, and example files.

# the purpose of this script is to extract genes of interest from next-generation RNAseq data.

# the script requires the following as input:

    # 1. A reference genome in .fasta format.
    # 2. Paired-end RNAseq data in .fastq format.
    # 3. A gene of interest from the reference genome in .bam format.
    
# I am working on versions of this script that will work with just a gene of interest rather than a reference genome.
